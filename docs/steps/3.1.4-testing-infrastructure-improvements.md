# Phase 3.1.4: Testing Infrastructure Improvements

## Overview

This step focuses on modernizing the testing infrastructure for the template-related components implemented in previous steps. Current tests for TemplateSelector, TemplateForm, and TemplateBrowser components are encountering issues with TypeScript compatibility and proper mocking of the React testing environment. This step will address these issues and ensure that all template-related components have thorough test coverage.

## Dependencies

- React and Ink (for terminal UI)
- Steps 3.1.1 (Conventional Commits), 3.1.2 (Custom Template Definition), and 3.1.3 (Template Selection UI) must be completed
- @testing-library/react for proper React component testing

## Prerequisites

- Phase 1 and 2 must be complete
- Step 3.1.3 (Template Selection UI) should be completed

## Issues to Address

1. Component Type Safety
   - Fix TypeScript errors in test files for template components
   - Ensure proper typing of component props and parameters
   - Address issues with `act` from testing libraries
   - Fix problems with type casting (e.g., `as any`) in component tests

2. Test Mocking Strategy
   - Create centralized, consistent mocks for Ink components
   - Improve mocking of SelectInput and TextInput components with proper TypeScript interfaces
   - Address issues with useInput hook mocking and keyboard event simulation
   - Create reusable mock factory functions for common test patterns

3. Component Testing Architecture
   - Create a more maintainable testing architecture for Ink components
   - Implement better support for both class and function components
   - Add proper error boundaries for component testing
   - Fix React warnings related to act() in async tests

4. Test Coverage
   - Add missing tests for TemplateFormSelect component
   - Expand test coverage for keyboard interactions and navigation
   - Ensure proper testing of error handling and edge cases
   - Improve test documentation and organization

- [ ] Fix TemplateBrowser.test.tsx
  - Create fully typed mock for templateManager
  - Fix missing act() wrappers for async component updates
  - Add proper error handling tests
  - Add tests for component state transitions

- [ ] Create TemplateFormSelect.test.tsx
  - Add tests for TemplateFormSelect component
  - Test proper rendering of selected and unselected states
  - Test correct handling of item props
  - Ensure proper styling of selected items

### 4. Add Advanced Testing Scenarios

- [ ] Add keyboard navigation tests
  - Test Tab key handling between form fields
  - Test arrow key navigation in select inputs
  - Test Escape key for cancellation
  - Test Enter key for form submission

- [ ] Add tests for template validation
  - Test required field validation
  - Test format string validation
  - Test error handling for invalid templates
  - Test dynamic form generation based on template fields

- [ ] Add tests for template loading
  - Test loading from default templates directory
  - Test loading from user templates directory
  - Test error handling for template loading failures
  - Test handling of both JSON and YAML template formats

- [ ] Add tests for component integration
  - Test TemplateBrowser with TemplateSelector and TemplateForm together
  - Test proper data flow between components
  - Test proper state management during component transitions
  - Test error boundary behaviors

### 4. Address Specific Current Test Issues

- [ ] Fix act() warning issues
  - Wrap all component renders in act() calls
  - Add proper async handling with await for all act() calls
  - Add proper timeout handling for useEffect hooks
  - Follow React testing best practices for handling async updates

- [ ] Fix inconsistent mocking approaches
  - Use consistent approach for all component mocks
  - Prefer function components over class components when possible
  - Use proper TypeScript typing for all mock components
  - Avoid using any type where possible

- [ ] Resolve class vs function component incompatibilities
  - Use consistent component patterns across the codebase
  - Create proper type-safe wrappers when needed
  - Document any remaining type casting with clear explanations
  - Consider refactoring TemplateSelector to use consistent component paradigm

- [ ] Address unused variable warnings
  - Fix all TypeScript linting errors related to unused variables
  - Use proper destructuring patterns to avoid unused variables
  - Add appropriate TypeScript directives when variables are intentionally unused
  - Remove any dead code or unnecessary variables

## Definition of Done

- All tests for template components pass without TypeScript errors or warnings
- Test coverage for template components is comprehensive (>80%)
- Template selection UI functions correctly with proper keyboard navigation
- Error handling is thoroughly tested for all edge cases
- No act() warnings are present in the test output
- All type casts are documented and justified
- Tests provide clear documentation of component behavior

## Implementation Recommendations

1. Start by setting up a proper testing utilities file to centralize mocking logic
2. Add proper imports for testing libraries before fixing individual test files
3. Address global type declarations before fixing individual component tests
4. Use consistent patterns for all component mocks
5. Consider using testing-library/react-hooks for cleaner hook testing
6. Document any workarounds or type casts that cannot be avoided
7. Consider creating a testing guide for future component testing

## Next Steps

After completing this step, we will have a robust testing infrastructure for template-related components. The next step will be to implement the Pattern Detection Engine (Phase 3.2.1), which will analyze commit messages for common patterns and provide warnings or suggestions.
