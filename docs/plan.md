# Zen Commit Implementation Plan

## Project Overview

Zen Commit is a CLI utility that enhances the Git commit experience by creating a more mindful, intentional commit process. It helps developers write better commit messages, review their changes more effectively, and maintain a clean commit history.

## Project Structure

This implementation plan is organized into phases, each containing multiple steps. Each step is designed to be a focused, standalone unit of work that can be implemented as a separate GitHub PR to avoid large, monolithic changes.

## Development Guidelines

- Always check for **both global and project-specific** Claude.md files for guidance
  - If there's a conflict, project-specific settings override global settings
  - In absence of conflicts, adhere to both sets of guidelines
- Use detailed checklists for task completion
- Provide specific, unambiguous implementation instructions
- Keep PRs small and focused on a single concern
- Reference git history when understanding features or API design decisions using `gh` commands
- Follow TDD (Test-Driven Development) workflow:
  1. Write tests first, commit them
  2. Verify tests fail as expected
  3. Implement code to make tests pass
  4. Commit passing implementation
  5. Create GitHub PR using `gh` CLI
  6. Update `docs/plan.md` with task status
